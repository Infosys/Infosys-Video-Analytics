# Infosys Video Analytics

### Introduction

Infosys Video Analytics(IVA) is constructed using .NET 8.0. It reads frames from a video file and makes an API call to the Python Inference API pipeline by sending a JSON request (refer to [References](#-References) section). The response from the Python Inference pipeline is then used to render the output video. This tool is designed to facilitate video analysis and processing using advanced machine learning models.

IVA(Infosys IP) offers a flexible, vendor-neutral approach for end-to-end Computer Vision services. It supports a range of AI models, including cutting-edge next-gen Generative AI, pre-configured for diverse vision tasks. Additionally multiple hardware like NVidia Jetson, Raspberry, Drone etc. are supported with IVA. IVA seamlessly blends on-premise, Cloud, Edge, AI & Vision technologies.

The current release of Infosys Video Analytics (IVA) is version 3.5, which has been upgraded to use .NET 8.0, whereas the previous release was based on .NET 6.0. This upgrade brings enhanced performance, improved compatibility, and access to the latest features of the .NET 8.0 framework. The documentation reflects this change, highlighting the transition to the newer framework as part of the ongoing improvements in IVA.

### Architecture

![alt text](Docs/Architecturepic.png)

- **Framework**: IVA is constructed using .NET 8.0.
- **Data Flow**:

  - Reads frames from a video/image file.
  - Sends a JSON request to the Python Inference API pipeline. (refer to [References](#-References) section for sample JSON request and response structures)
  - Receives the response and renders the output video.
- **Components**:

  - **Frame Grabber**: Captures frames from the input video/image.
  - **Frame Predictor**: Processes frames using the Python model API.
  - **Data Collector**: Collects data for further processing.
  - **Frame Renderer**: Renders the processed frames into a video.
    Data Collector
  - This module stores AI prediction metadata to the database. It can be used for downstream applications, analytics and notification purposes.
  - It comprises of SQL Server database (for persistent storage), Blob storage (for temporary storage), Queue- MSMQ, Kafka (for transient storage of messages), disk storage. SQL stores structured data like prediction results from AI models, Blob stores image frames, Queue stores messages which are transmitted through various modules of pipeline, disks can store image, videos.
    Rendering:
  - The rendering part is modified as per the new schema for the models and conditions for executing specific models are specified in the configuration file based on that model is executed.
  - Multiple attributes are set for the models based on that it will render model and generate the output video.

- **Workflow**:

  1. Upload the image/video to IVA.
  2. The Frame Grabber captures frames and transmits them to the Frame Predictor.
  3. The Frame Predictor forwards the data to the Data Collector and Frame Renderer.
  4. The rendered video output can be viewed using VLC media player.

### New Features in Release IVA-3.5

#### IVA Core pipeline features -

#### IMIL Library 

This library will helps in testing the local python inference with IVA for different models. 
- IMIL library is used to test local python inference testing with IVA, as its easy to deploy, single library for local invocation with provision for adding custom models, we need the library folder with the help of that the iva will run the local python execution.

#### PCD Handling 

This component is independent and also helps in reading PCD â€“ Point Cloud Data files in any format.
- Prompt handler enables usage of prompts in IVA pipeline. IVA will be able to use models that can accept prompt as input with prompt handler. Prompts can be provided before the start of the process or at runtime in a text file. 
- Prompt Handler node is independent and can read prompts from a text file giving the ability to allow other inputs with prompt like video or image. Using prompt templates, Prompt handler will structure the prompt in a format which can be accepted/read by the model as input. 
- Prompt Injector is used to read the prompt from an external source, and this is done using LIF adapters. An external source will send a prompt to Kafka server which prompt injector is listens to via adapters. It reads the prompt from Kafka server and injects it into prompt handler. The prompt handler further uses the prompt to process, format it is using a prompt template defined.  

#### Explainability 

This component that is responsible for handling Explainability for the predicted frames from AI Predictor and Save the data into database. 
- Explainability support is provided for the predicted frame from AI predictor node, based on the template configured in the Database and Device.json. It supports explainability based on the confidence score, label etc., based on the template configured in the database.

#### Data Aggregator 

This component handles the messages from multiple frame processor nodes and aggregates the predicted data as per the frame id and forwards it to the next node in the pipeline. 

#### Frame Viewer: 

Frame Viewer is a new component added in IVA to perform any kind of operation on raw data using ffmpeg. 

#### Prompt Handling: 
- Prompt handler enables usage of prompts in IVA pipeline. IVA will be able to use models that can accept prompt as input with prompt handler. Prompts can be provided before the start of the process or at runtime in a text file. 
- Prompt Handler node is independent and can read prompts from a text file giving the ability to allow other inputs with prompt like video or image. Using prompt templates, Prompt handler will structure the prompt in a format which can be accepted/read by the model as input. 
- Prompt Injector is used to read the prompt from an external source, and this is done using LIF adapters. An external source will send a prompt to Kafka server which prompt injector is listens to via adapters. It reads the prompt from Kafka server and injects it into prompt handler. The prompt handler further uses the prompt to process, format it is using a prompt template defined. 

#### Multi Model Chaining: 
- Model chaining feature lets us use IVA to run multiple AI models that can be configured in the pipeline either in sequence or in parallel. In this release only frame processor supports model chaining feature. 
- With model chaining, IVA has the capability to merge the inference results from multiple models configured in the pipeline. Inference data of one model can be sent as input to another model. Data can be merged and utilized to increase consistency and accuracy.

#### LIF features -

#### Secret Configurations: 
- IVA configurations which are sensitive or need to be secured can be stored in Azure or AWS services. These stored configurations or information can be retrieved using LIF adapters which include the support for both Azure and AWS. 

#### Rabbit MQ:  
- Rabbit MQ is an open-source message/event streaming platform. Configured to send messages across components of IVA. Can also be configured to send messages out of IVA as they are stored in topics and accessed by the applications/components or external sources. 

#### Azure IOT:  
- Azure Iot Adapter is configured to send messages across components of IVA. It uses Azure IoT Hub as a medium to receive messages and store in Azure Queue which can be accessed by the applications/components or external sources.
