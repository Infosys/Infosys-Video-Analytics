# Introduction ðŸ“š
- This project provides a set of adapters for integrating various messaging systems with our core application. The adapters include implementations for Kafka, RabbitMQ, MSMQ, and more. Each adapter is designed to facilitate seamless communication between the core application and the respective messaging system, ensuring reliable and efficient message handling.

- The primary objective of this project is to offer a flexible and extensible solution for integrating different messaging systems, making it easier for developers to work with multiple message brokers without having to deal with the complexities of each system individually.
